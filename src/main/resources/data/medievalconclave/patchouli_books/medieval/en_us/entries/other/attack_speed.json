      "text": "As said in those powers, unique abilities can only be applied when you're doing full damage, or rather, full hits. This however is really hard to check, that is because we use custom weapons in the server, a longsword for example has 1.8 attack speed, while a custom longsword can have 2 attack speed. That's why I will use marges, the marge for every attack will be 0.2."
